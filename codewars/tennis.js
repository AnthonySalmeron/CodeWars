// In tennis, the winner of a set is based on how many games each player wins. The first player to win 6 games is declared the winner unless their opponent had already won 5 games, in which case the set continues until one of the players has won 7 games.
//
// Given two integers score1 and score2, your task is to determine if it is possible for a tennis set to be finished with a final score of score1 : score2.

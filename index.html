      <h1>Full Name: Anthony Ernesto Salmeron</h1>
      <p> I was born in Boston and lived my early life in Eastie before moving to Revere when I was about six years old. I'm the first of four children to two first generation immigrants. My parents came from great poverty in El Salvador and decided tehy needed to uproot themselves and work hard here to give me and any kids that came after a fighting chance. Life wasn't easy, especially the first 10 or so years when my dad worked two full time jobs and my mom was constantly stressed and I didn't have anybody to turn to at school because I was a minority in my neighborhood and my expereineces in elementary made me into an introvert. I got into Boston University, thinking I would want to do biomedical engineering because it seemed to be an interesting high growth career where I could use my talents to help the less fortunate. Unfortunately, I never really got to feel comfortable in university, the classes were hard but doable, but not on top of also having family pressure to work as much as possible. Add to that the imposter syndrome I acquired from being surrounded by other people who had money and backgrounds that made the experience easier for them. I did alright until my sophmore year when I failed some important classes after having my anxiety spike in just one of my courses. I decided to take a break for a year but when I came back, I didn't actually believe I wanted to continue with what I was doing anymore. So I dropped out and that's when one of my friends first told me about Resilient Coders. I wasn't able to go to a hackathon until August of 2019 but when I finally did, I knew for once I was going to get myself into something that could make me genuinely happy. I'm up for the chaallenge and I love the community, I hope to grow and shine like the mentors I have and the alumn that came before me and hopefully one day pass it on to those who come next.
